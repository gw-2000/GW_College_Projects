# GW_College_Projects
A list of previous college projects undertaken using a range of software, primarily GIS and Python. This repository has been created to showcase my use and exposure to programming to date. 
Experience in: Python (IDLE, Jupyter Notbook), ArcGIS online, R (Rstudio), HTML & CSS (codesandbox.io)

Earlier projects undertaken in python were coded using **IDLE**, however, later projects which involved the use of the Pandas dataframe was coded using **Jupyter Notebook**.

To date, GIS projects have been completed with the use of **ArcGis Online**.
